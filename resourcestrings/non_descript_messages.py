We are pleased to have you here and want to take this opportunity to lay out the next steps in your journey with us.

Firstly, most of who and what we are can be found in <#458793337558663178>. 
There you will find our ranking system clearly laid out. 
If you are a player that needs some advice on your toon(s), we have class captains of every role and toon type. 
Please reach out to any officer *(Aesir or above)* about hooking you up with the right mentor. 
If you are more of a seasoned player and are itching to get into one of our runs, take a look at <#556956138852057098> for how to use Asuna, our signup bot. 
If you are interested in joining one of our progression teams, please reach out to *Blitznacht*, *Angiefaerie*, or *Aerina Filauria*.

Next, we want you to know that **_Incurable Insanity_** is a welcoming and fun place for people to have a great time and kick ass. 

We have **__3__ rules**: **__no drama__**, **__no elitism__**, **__help people__**. 
            
We do **__not__ tolerate** any **hateful speech**, but we **_adore_ bad puns and innuendo**. 
So please feel free let myself or any of the officers know what your in-game goals are and we would love to help you meet those goals!

    - **Angiefaerie, GM**"""
